  abstract = {This deliverable is the demonstrator deliverable for TROMPAâ€™s orchestra use case. The main purpose of this document is to present the prototype(s) developed for the given use case, linking to the implementation, discussing main functionalities, and explaining how the work connects to the overall TROMPA project. The current prototypes evolved from an earlier release in M24 of the project, that went through intermediate usability and functionality evaluation with relevant audiences (Deliverable 6.8 - Mid-term evaluation). For the orchestras use case, these audiences consist of semi-professional and amateur youth orchestra players.
