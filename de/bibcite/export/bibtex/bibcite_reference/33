  title = {Deliverable 6.6 - Working Prototype for Singers v2},
  abstract = {This deliverable is the demonstrator deliverable for the choir singers pilot submitted on M34 of the project. This deliverable is submitted concurrently with the other WP6 pilot deliverables (D6.3, D6.4, D6.5 and D6.7) that are the main deliverables related to Milestone 4 - Working integrated prototypes ready v2.0. These deliverables are demonstrators rather than detailed reports, thus their main purpose of this document is to present the functionalities of the pilot and a link to its actual implementation. However we choose to present other facets as well, such as relation to other Work Packages and integration of the TROMPA tools, as well as user involvement.
