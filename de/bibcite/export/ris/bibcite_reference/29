AB - This document presents the Hybrid Annotation Workflows models and technology developed in the TROMPA Project, a workflow which combines human annotators and AI technology in an intelligent hybrid crowdsourcing system. 
Building on the conceptual model for annotator properties and metrics defined in D4.2, the work presented in this deliverable aims supporting the seamless integration of the automatic processes produced in WP3 with the activities of crowd contributors to enable the efficient and effective  description of multimodal music data sources. D4.4 also lays the foundations for the design and development of a framework for the continuous evaluation and improvement of technologies developed in WP3.
