  abstract = {This document summarises the TROMPA dissemination output of the project and has been submitted each year. Here we list talks, publications, workshops, software, blog and other public facing engagements produced in the past year. We provide a detailed summary of all tangible deliverables and relate them to our initial proposed plan. Where we did not meet our listed goals, we explain why this was the case. Most failures to produce were related to the COVID-19 global pandemic.    Despite these challenges, we have been able to disseminate our work across a wide body of mediums across all of our work packages. We further list projects related to and enabled by TROMPA that have promising future development as well as projects that have been submitted for academic dissemination.
