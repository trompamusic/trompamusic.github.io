  title = {Early requirements},
  abstract = {The Trompa project strives to create systems for multiple audiences, involving these audiences during
the planning, soliciting their feedback during the iterative refinement and feature delivery process, as
well as inviting them to contribute their musical knowledge using the created systems. The early
requirements planning concerns itself with the first part – soliciting user feedback for the first version of
use cases developed by TROMPA. This deliverable comprises the requirements elicitation methodology,
the resulting application scenarios and user stories and high-level functional/non-functional
requirements that are based on application scenarios and user stories developed in the tasks T2.1 and
T2.2. Deliverables D5.1 and D4.2 draw upon the functional requirements and application scenarios
covered in this deliverable, as well as, naturally, most other following deliverables.},
