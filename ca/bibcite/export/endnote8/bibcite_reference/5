The aim of this&#13;
deliverable is to provide information on how the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)&#13;
data requirement will be satisfied in the data created during TROMPA.&#13;
This deliverable contains the Data Management Plan (D8.4), a deliverable that belongs to WP8 of&#13;
the project, devoted to project coordination. This document contains its first version (M6) and is&#13;
designed as a living document that will be updated along the project, in M18 and M36 respectively.&#13;
We describe here the procedure used in the project to handle the data collected and generated&#13;
during the project, following the Horizon 2020 online manual.&#13;
We start by summarizing the main characteristics of TROMPA data, having in mind the main goal&#13;
of TROMPA, indicated in its acronym, i.e. to enrich existing online music public-domain archives. We&#13;
first specify the considered music data types (audio, video, music scores, text and images), formats&#13;
(with an emphasis on open and standard formats) and sources (external sources, data from&#13;
consortium and associated partners, data generated by TROMPA technologies in WP3, crowd&#13;
contributions in WP4 and additional relevant sources). We then specify the target criteria for size,&#13;
reusability and the link of data with the different TROMPA use cases and user communities. This&#13;
allow us to define a list of existing open repositories our project will link and contribute to.&#13;
The data generated during the TROMPA project will fulfil the FAIR standard: it will be Findable,&#13;
Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. We describe in this deliverable how the TROMPA&#13;
consortium will work to fulfil this FAIR criteria, providing specific details and indications for&#13;
discoverability, identifiability, naming, versioning, availability as open data, documentation, and&#13;
re-usability. We also discuss about licensing, software tools, quality assurance and conditions to&#13;
preserve it in the future. In addition, we consider the required allocation of resources for managing&#13;
that, estimating the cost, resources, responsibilities and potential value for long term preservation.&#13;
Moreover, we discuss about data security and the ethical aspects linked to data.&#13;
This methodology is for the moment wide and comprehensive in order to be refined during the&#13;
project according to the precise definition and evolution of the use-cases and the work carried out in&#13;
the different work packages.</style></abstract></record></records></xml>
