AB - The alignment of multimodal musical resources, for unified exploration, discovery, and retrieval, represents an important priority in enriching digital music archives. In this document, we provide a description of various types of information resource subject to potential alignment within TROMPA; detail a number of candidate algorithms to perform alignment activities; and present a data model that provides a framework for the application of alignment outcomes in TROMPA use cases. We also present a set of initial resources subject to proposed alignment in future development of this deliverable, comprising Beethoven piano compositions, and early Spanish choral works.
