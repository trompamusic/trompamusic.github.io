preserving the musical content of classical music works. Music notation evolved since about the&#13;
tenth century and is universally understood by professional musicians, i.e. those most likely to&#13;
generate the performances discussed and appreciated by their audiences. At the same time, it is not&#13;
necessary to understand music notation to appreciate and enjoy classical music, so TROMPA does&#13;
not expect its community of music-enthusiasts to read it, although many members of this&#13;
community will be able to do so.&#13;
Digital scores, either rendered from MEI encodings via the TROMPA Data Infrastructure, or from&#13;
PDF or other graphic files representing physical library documents (such as the historic printed&#13;
scores available via IMSLP, or the early music prints in EMO), will find extensive use throughout WPs&#13;
3, 4, 5 & 6.
The Digital Score Edition component of TROMPA is to a large extent based on the Music Encoding
and Linked Data (MELD) [1] technology developed in prior projects FAST1 and Transforming
Musicology2; this will be adapted and augmented for the specific purposes of TROMPA. It combines&#13;
use of the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) format for representing musical documents with a&#13;
semantic approach tailored to the requirements of musicians and music scholars, using Linked Data.&#13;
This document describes the essentials of the Digital Score Edition component and summarises&#13;
how they will be put to use in various use-cases. It largely focuses on new elements being introduced&#13;
for TROMPA, in particular, methods for user-contributed and automated annotations which preserve&#13;
provenance and maintain user control; to a large extent this is ground-breaking work, so some&#13;
research questions (see 1.2 Annotations and links) remain open.&#13;
The Digital Score Edition component of TROMPA closely interacts with the Contributor&#13;
Environment (WP5 - TROMPA Contributor Environment) via TROMPAâ€™s Data Infrastructure (TR-D5.1-&#13;
Data Infrastructure v1). We expect it to find use to a greater or lesser extent in the following Tasks:&#13;
3.2 (Music description); 3.4 (Visual analysis of scores); 3.6 (Multimodal cross-linking); 5.3&#13;
(Multimodal integration of music data); 5.4 (Music performance assessment mechanisms); 6.2 (Pilot&#13;
for music scholars); 6.3 (Pilot for orchestras); 6.4 (Pilot for instrument players); 6.5 (Pilot for singers)</style></abstract></record></records></xml>
